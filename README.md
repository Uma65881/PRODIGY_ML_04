# Task-05: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Project Overview

**Task-05** is a machine learning project focused on developing a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. This tool aims to assist users in tracking their dietary intake, promoting healthier eating habits, and making informed food choices.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient model capable of identifying different food items from images and providing an estimate of their calorie content. This model can be used in various applications such as nutrition tracking, diet planning, and health monitoring.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), which includes:

- **101 different food categories** with **1,000 images per category**.
- **Training set**: 75,750 images.
- **Test set**: 25,250 images.

The dataset covers a wide range of food items, making it suitable for training a comprehensive food recognition model.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.10.8
- TensorFlow 2.10.0
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Pillow

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Uma65881/PRODIGY_ML_04.git
cd Task-05
Set up the environment:

Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.
Train the model:

Run the food_recognition.py script to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python food_recognition.py
Test the model:

Use the test dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
Calorie Estimation:

After recognizing the food item, the model estimates its calorie content based on predefined nutritional information.
Model Performance
The model is designed to achieve high accuracy in recognizing food items and estimating their calorie content. Performance metrics and accuracy details will be provided after the model evaluation.

Future Work
Planned future enhancements include:

Improving calorie estimation accuracy with more detailed nutritional data.
Developing a user-friendly GUI for easier interaction with the model.
Implementing real-time food recognition using mobile or webcam inputs.
